# RAG-with-LLAMA2-and-LlamaIndex

## Introduction
This project integrates the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with LLAMA2 and LlamaIndex to create a powerful language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines the best of retrieval and generative models for improved performance.
- **LLAMA2 Integration**: Utilizes the advanced capabilities of the LLAMA2 model for language understanding and generation.
- **LlamaIndex**: Employs LlamaIndex for efficient data retrieval, which is crucial for the RAG architecture.
